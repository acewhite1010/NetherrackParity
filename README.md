1.14+ Netherrack Parity Texture Packs for Better Bitrate in Speedrunning!

Get them [here](https://github.com/acewhite1010/NetherrackParity/releases/latest)

## Q&A
How to use it?
- Just straight away chuck the downloaded ZIP file into your /texturepacks (pre 1.6) or /resourcepacks (1.6+) folder!

Is this legal for speedrunning?
- Yes!

Why does it not work?
- Make sure you're having the ZIP file in the correct folder. Otherwise, send me a DM via Discord (acewhite#4025) so I can troubleshoot and update.
