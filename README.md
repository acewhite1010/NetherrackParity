## Q&A

How to use it?
- Just straight away chuck the downloaded ZIP file into your /texturepacks (pre 1.6) or /resourcepacks (1.6+) folder!

Is this legal for speedrunning?
- Currently yes, but will change as soon as the leaderboard staff announces the new rules about resource packs.

Why does it not work?
- Make sure you're having the ZIP file in the correct folder. Otherwise, send me a DM via Discord (acewhite#4025) so I can troubleshoot and update.

Hmm... I don't see some versions I want...
- There's a lot of them in the releases page, click "Show all assets" (or something similar to those lines) and it should show!
